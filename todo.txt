1. First just to call github API


Note:

It seems that i cant get issue name in a single GET request issues/comments
so i need to do a request to each issues url...

If we theory i only need comments for a specific ONE day.
that means there will not be more than 30 comments per day. So it equals to do 30 request for issues 
information

The solution maybe will be to:
fetch /issues for only 1 repo (learning) for 1 day.
then get all comments for 1 day of each issues

since parameter returns only updated comments... bad for me.
