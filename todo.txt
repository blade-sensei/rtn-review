1. First just to call github API


Note:

P: It seems that i cant get issue name in a single GET request issues/comments
so i need to do a request to each issues url...

S: If we theory i only need comments for a specific ONE day.
that means there will not be more than 30 comments per day. So it equals to do 30 request for issues 
information

The solution maybe will be to:
fetch /issues for only 1 repo (learning) for 1 day.
then get all comments for 1 day of each issues

P: since parameter returns only updated comments... bad for me.

S: The solution would be to fetch all issues. Filter only issues that match with
specific day/date, when create requests to get comments of issues.

P: With Github RestAPI i can get issues of user ( i didnt tried but it seems you can)
i can also get issues from specific repository. 
But in any case the response doesnt provide comments arrays.
One solution could be to fetch comments directly with "issues/comments" route BUT
the response doesnt provide "issue" information, so in both cases i need to do 
more requests for issues or comments. 

S: Github also provides GraphQL API i did some test this query works for me
query {
  
  viewer {
  issues(
    first: 5
    orderBy: { field: UPDATED_AT, direction: ASC},
    filterBy: { since: "2020-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
  ) {
      edges {
        node {
          repository {
            name
          }
          labels(first: 4) {
            edges {
              node {
                name
              }
            }
          }
          title,
          createdAt,
          updatedAt
          state
          comments(first:10) {
            edges {
              node {
                body
                createdAt,
                updatedAt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

This query allow me to get 
issues of specific date. I will pick first 5 issues WHY ?
As we cant request issues for 1 ONLY DAY, i can only get 
AFTER DATE issues.
Solution: As the response is ASC the first objects are the closest to the date
i don't need the latest objects. This is to match and only get the 
issues of the DAY.

Then i can get issues information like labels/name/number/state (without need extra request
as like using rest API)

I can access comments directly, i assume that i will not comment more than 10 times 
an issue. so i set limit to first 10 comments per issue.

I can call GraphQL API Github with Apollo 
I pass client apollo instance. Works in browser

Now i need to refactor components
- Issue  to display issue name, number, tags name, state (open/close)
- Comment display title, date, content.
- Issuing function components (not class)

Next:
Primary
- toggle issues first DONE
- toggle comment DONE
- filter comment for specific date DONE
- graphql add parameter for date DONE

- Date picker doesnt work when we change it (no update), i think it
beacause we set the state and after we call graphql but as setState is 
async grpaql has not the current date changed  DONE 
Second
- Format dates done
- change size images done
- add icon to open/close done
- label colors
