1. First just to call github API


Note:

P: It seems that i cant get issue name in a single GET request issues/comments
so i need to do a request to each issues url...

S: If we theory i only need comments for a specific ONE day.
that means there will not be more than 30 comments per day. So it equals to do 30 request for issues 
information

The solution maybe will be to:
fetch /issues for only 1 repo (learning) for 1 day.
then get all comments for 1 day of each issues

P: since parameter returns only updated comments... bad for me.

S: The solution would be to fetch all issues. Filter only issues that match with
specific day/date, when create requests to get comments of issues.

P: With Github RestAPI i can get issues of user ( i didnt tried but it seems you can)
i can also get issues from specific repository. 
But in any case the response doesnt provide comments arrays.
One solution could be to fetch comments directly with "issues/comments" route BUT
the response doesnt provide "issue" information, so in both cases i need to do 
more requests for issues or comments. 

S: Github also provides GraphQL API i did some test this query works for me
query {
  
  viewer {
  issues(
    first: 5
    orderBy: { field: UPDATED_AT, direction: ASC},
    filterBy: { since: "2020-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
  ) {
      edges {
        node {
          repository {
            name
          }
          labels(first: 4) {
            edges {
              node {
                name
              }
            }
          }
          title,
          createdAt,
          updatedAt
          state
          comments(first:10) {
            edges {
              node {
                body
                createdAt,
                updatedAt
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
